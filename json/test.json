Please do not submit any generated code as part of the project, if you are using sass or less, css should not be part of the project.

The link items should disappear for the mobile version and be rendered as a list above the shrunken hero when the mobile menu has been toggled. The banner is a big image that should be shrunken to a reasonable size (maybe same size as menu) on mobile. The footer contains an input field where the user can enter his/her email address. On the left side there are a few links. For the mobile version, please only display the Hyperlink block.",
